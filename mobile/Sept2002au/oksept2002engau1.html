<strong>Gokkun Umaji Mura!<br />

Page 1 of 7<br /><br />
<p><a href="gokkunbottleau.html" name="gokkunbottle">'Gokkun'</a>&#58; it's a Kochi institution.  Arguably the most famous name associated with the unique fruit known as yuzu.  We interviewed <a href="toutaniau.html" name="toutani">Mochifumi Toutani</a>, Representative Managing Director of the Umaji Village Farming Cooperative Society to get the lowdown on yuzu, and its relationship to Umaji.</p>  
<p>Oi! Kochi (OK): First, can you tell us about your company and what it is you make?</p>
<p>Mr. Mochifumi Toutani (MT): It's not a company; it's an organization: a  co-operative made by farmers.  There are 650 members from 340 households.  Umaji's population is a bit more than 1200, and the only produce we have is yuzu.  There are a number of rice paddies, but the farmers only grow enough rice to feed their own families.</p>
<p>OK: For those who don't know what yuzu is, can you please explain what it actually is and what it tastes like?</p>
<p>MT: Well, if they could drink it...to explain with words is kind of... If the people who don't know what Yuzu is could smell its fragrance and taste it on their tongues, that would be the best way to show them.  I can't explain it with words really.</p>
<p>OK: It's not a lemon, but is it sour like one?</p>
<p>MT: Lemon, lime, with other types of citron; they're all aromatic citrus fruits.</p>
