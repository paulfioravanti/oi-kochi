<strong>Gokkun Umaji Mura!</strong><br />
Page 7 of 7<br /><br />
<p>OK: However, the character is within Umaji for other things apart from Gokkun, such as the Umaji Heart Attack Marathon, right?</p>
<p>MT: It's also used for Umaji tourism and onsen pamphlets.  Though, if it's not presented as a unified image, and used carelessly on unrelated material, its meaning becomes lost.</p>
<p>OK: I have to admit that I like to mix Gokkun and shochu to make a 'Gokkun-wari', so I was wondering whether you had plans to sell your own mixture of yuzu and shochu.</p>
<p>MT: We're in the foodstuffs business only, and currently have no plans to undertake alcohol production on a large scale.  We do sell some alcoholic products through mail order, but we don't think there are that many customers who would want them from us.</p>
<p>OK: Have you thought about any new products?</p>
<p>MT: Yes.  We're thinking of making yuzu lotion, soap, shampoo products; items for everyday use.</p>
<p>OK: Do you have a final message for Oi! Kochi readers?</p>
<p>MT: To those who have not tasted or drunk <a href="umajiau.html" name="umaji">Umaji</a>, and to those that have, please come and visit us!</p>
