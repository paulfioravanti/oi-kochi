<strong>Spice Up Your Life!<br />
by Paul Fioravanti</strong><br />
Page 1 of 5<br /><br />
<p>A few months ago, Kochi had its first taste of Indian curry.  Many people rushed out to devour this new experience, yet some are still a bit hesitant to discover the joys of the real deal.  Oi! Kochi spoke to <a href="sureramasalaflashau.html" name="surera">Surera Sunderlal</a>, head chef at Masala Restaurant, about his life and eating curry in Japan.</p>
<p>Oi! Kochi (OK): What brought you to Kochi Prefecture?  </p>
<p>Surera Sunderlal (SS): Personally, I came to Kochi because of my job and our company.  There had been no Indian restaurants here before, so we came to test it out.  </p>
<p>OK: Have you worked anywhere else in Japan?</p>
<p>SS: I've worked in Mie Prefecture for one year, then Miyazaki prefecture for a year, and then moved to Tokushima where I worked for seven years and three months.  </p>
<p>OK: Did your family come along with you to Japan?</p>
<p>SS: No, I'm living in Japan single.</p>
<p>OK: How often are you able to travel back home?</p>
<p>SS: I'm able to travel back home once a year on vacation.</p>
