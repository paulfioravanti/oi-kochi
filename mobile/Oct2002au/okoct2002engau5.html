<p>OK: What do you think of Japanese style curry?</p>
<p>SS:  When I came to Japan, I tried their curry.  First, I thought to myself, how can you make curry like this? (Laughs) Then I just thought much depends on what people are used to.  I like Japanese curry, but I like Indian curry better.</p>
<p>OK: If you could eat the curry from heaven, what taste do you think it would have?</p>
<p>SS: In my own thinking, that's not really possible, as all people are a part of God, and as God gives brains for good thinking, the intelligent people can make and prepare the curry for the world.  So, it is like God has made the curry.</p>
<p>OK: What would you say to people who have yet to try a real Indian curry?</p>
<p>SS:  First I want to thank Japanese people for liking our curry.  Second, some Japanese people think Indian curry is spicy and they cannot possibly like it, so I'd like to tell them that our Indian curry can be made so it is not so different to Japanese-style; you can test our cooking and then think about trying Indian curry.  Any people can have curry in their diet and be healthy and not have it impact on their health.</p>
