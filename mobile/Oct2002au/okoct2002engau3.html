<p>OK: Is there a secret or special technique to making a really good curry?  </p>
<p>SS:  Every company and every chef likes to make good curries with different recipes.   Sometimes we have time to think about new techniques or new curries, but working in Japan we don't get so much time to think about new techniques or new curry recipes and so we can think only about the job at hand.</p>
<p>OK:  Do you make the curries at the <a href="masalarestaurant2au.html" name="masalarestaurant">restaurant</a> to suit the tastes of Japanese customers?</p>
<p>SS: In our company, we can prepare Japanese-style curry.  Many ordinary Japanese people think Indian curry is too spicy, so we make sure we can put the spice levels at the discretion of the customer.  Maybe there are some people who think that eating spicy curries are bad for your health.  So, if you like spicy curries or hot curries, you can order either.</p>
<p>OK:  So then do you find more Japanese people tend to eat mild curry more than hot curry?</p>
<p>SS:  Mostly young people like hot curries, while most of the older people like their curry mild.</p>
