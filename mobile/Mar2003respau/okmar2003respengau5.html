<p>&nbsp;ii. For non-exempt countries<br />After successful passing of the aptitude test, the theoretical exam will be taken, and once this is passed, the practical examination will be taken.<br />(Aptitude test) - Involves eyesight, hearing, and physical abilities testing.<br />(Theoretical exam) - Involves 10 true/false questions<br />(Practical exam) - This exam is determined uniformly on a national level by the National Police Agency according to the 'Driver's License Practical Exam Implementation Criteria', particulars of which are also specifically covered therein, and is implemented strictly in accordance to this criteria. <br />As there are different types of license administration methods for different countries, we feel this may lead to much confusion, but to acquire a Japanese driver's license and drive within Japan, the practical exam based on the implementation criteria mentioned above must be passed.  Furthermore, in order to aim to pass the practical exam early, you can take practical lesson courses from any driving school, or borrow a practice car (charge applicable) at the Driving Centre to take an exam course held by the Road Safety Association.</p>
<p>e. Concerning the short lecture.<br />Regardless of whether you fall under the exempt country category or not, there is an obligation pursuant to the Road Traffic Act to attend a short lecture before acquiring your Japanese driver's license; it must be attended.</p>
