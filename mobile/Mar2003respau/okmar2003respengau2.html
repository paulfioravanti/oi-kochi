<p>However, for the majority of foreign residents living in Japan, taking time off work for 3 months while they return to their home countries to obtain a new international driver's license is essentially unfeasible.  So, since the changes to the Road Traffic Act last year, there have been many foreigners who have applied to have their home country driver's licenses changed to Japanese licenses.  Because the administration of the licenses is different for each country, we believe that there has been a lot of confusion.</p>
<p>As for the Driving License Centre, we will continue to act faithfully in accordance to the Road Traffic Act, but we will try to make improvements in its interpretation where we can, based on your valuable opinions, and do our best to alleviate your worries and make the driving license process more convenient for you.</p>
<p>Below, you will find answers based on the opinions that were brought up [in the article].  We would like to ask for your understanding.</p>
