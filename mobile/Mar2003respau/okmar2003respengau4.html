<p><u>2. Concerning applicable special cases of foreign driver's license holders being exempt (noted as coming from 'exempt countries') from undertaking a part of the driver's license examination process.</u></p>
<p>&nbsp;a. 20 countries were originally exempt from the exams by authority of the National Police Agency Road Traffic Office.  On February 1<sup>st</sup> 2003, Canada was added to this list, giving the present total number of 21 exempt countries. Concerning these exempt countries, the police designated them after taking into account their various traffic systems, and as we're sure you are aware, citizens of those countries need only take the aptitude test as they are exempt from the theoretical and practical examinations.</p>
<p>&nbsp;b. Holders of driver's licenses from countries other than the exempt countries are required to take the aptitude test, the theoretical exam, and the practical exam.</p>
<p>&nbsp;c. Concerning the aptitude, theoretical, and practical exams.</p>
<p>&nbsp;d.&nbsp;&nbsp;i. For exempt countries<br />After successful passing of the aptitude test, in accordance with the road traffic laws, there is an obligation to attend a short lecture, which must be adhered to.</p>
