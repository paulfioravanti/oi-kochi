<p><u>1. Concerning the ability of citizens of one country being able to drive in another country simply with their country's driver's license along with a translation of said license (issued by a government authority)</u></p>
<p>In order to try to prevent any risk of dangerous situations on the road, and strive for road traffic safety and harmony, only citizens from countries that have a driver's license standard equal to Japan (Federation of Switzerland, Federal Republic of Germany, Republic of France) are able to drive in Japan needing only their country's driver's license, along with a translation of said license (issued by a government authority).  There is a disparity between countries on this point, however, currently Japan only grants this privilege to the above three countries.</p>
<p>Consequently, drivers from countries other than the ones listed above must either possess an International Driver's License, or change their home country license to a Japanese license.</p>
