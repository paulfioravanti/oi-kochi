<strong>Driving Me<br />Round The Bend</strong><br />
Page 6 of 11<br /><br />
<p>An hour driving lesson was all I needed to learn the exact place to turn on my signal, what to say, when to say it, how many centremetres to drive from the inside or outside line and the other little things that have little to do with driving on the road.  The fourth and last test went without a hitch; the test giver didn't even open her book.</p> 
<p>After, I felt no joy or sense of accomplishment, just relief that I didn't have to use any more of my holidays to jump through the driving test hoop.  It don't think the test made me a better driver, nor do I think I grew very much as a person from the experience, but it is finished, and I can go back to what I enjoy doing without worry.  I do not think it is biased or racist in any way, just wrong.  In the end, I got over it and felt no bad feelings towards the testers, Japan, or the lawmakers.  What I took away from Ino-cho was a license I needed, and a deeper understanding of what Japanese must go through their whole lives: doing pointless tasks and tests to satisfy the bureaucrats."</p>
