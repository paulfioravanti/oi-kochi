<strong>Driving Me<br />Round The Bend</strong><br />
Page 4 of 11<br /><br />
<p>Here is a sample of the opinions of other non-Japanese residing in Kochi prefecture about their experiences on getting that laminated card. </p>
<p><strong>Person A, Country of Origin&#58; North America</strong><br />"Probably the most infuriating thing about driving in Japan is that they allow you to drive for an entire year with no problems.  Once that year is up though, perfect driving record or no, you have to suffer through an asinine series of tests that have nothing to do with actually driving on Japanese roads.  The test itself consists of driving on an enclosed track where what you have on your feet has as much bearing on whether you pass or fail as driving off the course and totaling the car would.  If you fail, the instructors might tell you what you did wrong, but only grudgingly and after making it clear that you're causing them undue trouble.  I guess that means safe driving is something best figured out by oneself.  Or possibly by spending ridiculous amounts of money on driving school, which just reinforces my belief that the whole system is simply a scam to make money. In total I had to use a fourth of my vacation days and paid well over 20,000 yen including transportation throughout the entire ordeal.  Were I not living out in the mountains, I probably would have given up long before I actually passed.  Where I live, however, having a car is not a simple convenience, it's a necessity."</p>
