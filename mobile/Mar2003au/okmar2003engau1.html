<strong>Driving Me<br />Round The Bend<br />

<p>A few months ago, driving laws in Japan were revised to the effect that all non-Japanese people residing in Japan after one year are now required to obtain a Japanese driver’s license.  This has caused a great inconvenience on many non-Japanese living in Kochi Prefecture, particularly those who reside in rural areas, and especially if that person is from a country that does not drive on the same side of the road as Japan.  If you are from a country that drives on the left hand side, such as the UK or Australia, then you are exempt from taking any exams to obtain your license.  If you are from a country that drives on the right hand side, such as the US or Canada, then you must attempt and pass a written and practical driving exam.  If you have had your license for less than three months in your home country, you must undertake driving lessons in Japan, as well as pass a written and practical driving exam after your International Driver's License has expired, regardless of which country you come from.</p>
