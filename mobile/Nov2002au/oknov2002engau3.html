<strong>Unsung Heroes of Tosa&#58;<br />The Nasu Farmer</strong><br />
Page 3 of 6<br /><br />
<p>Armed with cash in hand, I head off to Yasuda again to spend some time with my kenpo master, <a href="nasucutau.html" name="nasucut">Mr. Noriyoshi Nishiyama</a>, so that he might teach me a thing or two about the joys of <em>nasu</em>. Arriving at his house shortly before dusk, I am greeted by Mr. Nishiyama and his wife. He has a total of three greenhouses, all filled with neatly spaced rows of <em>nasu</em> plants. While farming is big business for people in Kochi, it is done on a comparatively small scale. He tells me that on average farmers tend to have 2&shy;3 greenhouses, something I find surprising given the vastness of farming enterprise in many western countries. </p>
<p>It's busy work nonetheless, as <em>nasu</em> is grown year-round, and work is done everyday.  Asked about his daily schedule, he replies, "I get up around six and begin work. Sometimes we'll continue working until ten at night. From March until June it's the peak season, so I'm busiest then."
