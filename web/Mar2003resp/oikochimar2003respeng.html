<h2>Kochi Driving Centre response to Oi! Kochi March 2003</h2>
<strong>English Translation: Paul Fioravanti</strong>
<p>&ensp;The Driving License Centre would like to kindly thank everyone for their exceptional cooperation regarding the recent administration of driving licenses.</p>
<p>&ensp;Responding to a contribution request from the International Exchange Newsletter ‘Oi! Kochi’, we would like to give our cooperation and provide a comprehensive explanation of the main points concerning the changing of a foreign country’s driver’s license to a Japanese license.</p>
<p>&ensp;As you are likely aware, new revisions of the Road Traffic Act were put into effect on June 1<sup>st</sup> 2002, which included a revision of the use of an International Driver’s License within Japan. If you obtain one in your home country and use it to drive in Japan until its period of use lapses, you are unable to drive on a new one unless you return to your home country and reside there for more than 3 months before re-entering Japan.  However, for the majority of foreign residents living in Japan, taking time off work for 3 months while they return to their home countries to obtain a new international driver’s license is essentially unfeasible.  So, since the changes to the Road Traffic Act last year, there have been many foreigners who have applied to have their home country driver’s licenses changed to Japanese licenses.  Because the administration of the licenses is different for each country, we believe that there has been a lot of confusion.</p>
<p>&ensp;As for the Driving License Centre, we will continue to act faithfully in accordance to the Road Traffic Act, but we will try to make improvements in its interpretation where we can, based on your valuable opinions, and do our best to alleviate your worries and make the driving license process more convenient for you.</p>
<p>&ensp;Below, you will find answers based on the opinions that were brought up [in the article].  We would like to ask for your understanding.</p>
<ol><li><u>Concerning the ability of citizens of one country being able to drive in another country simply with their country’s driver’s license along with a translation of said license (issued by a government authority)</u></li></ol>
<p>&ensp;In order to try to prevent any risk of dangerous situations on the road, and strive for road traffic safety and harmony, only citizens from countries that have a driver’s license standard equal to Japan (Federation of Switzerland, Federal Republic of Germany, Republic of France) are able to drive in Japan needing only their country’s driver’s license, along with a translation of said license (issued by a government authority).  There is a disparity between countries on this point, however, currently Japan only grants this privilege to the above three countries.</p>
<p>&ensp;Consequently, drivers from countries other than the ones listed above must either possess an International Driver’s License, or change their home country license to a Japanese license.</p>
<ol start="2"><li><u>Concerning applicable special cases of foreign driver’s license holders being exempt (noted as coming from ‘exempt countries’) from undertaking a part of the driver’s license examination process.</u></li></ol>
<ol type="a"><li>20 countries were originally exempt from the exams by authority of the National Police Agency Road Traffic Office.  On February 1<sup>st</sup> 2003, Canada was added to this list, giving the present total number of 21 exempt countries. Concerning these exempt countries, the police designated them after taking into account their various traffic systems, and as we’re sure you are aware, citizens of those countries need only take the aptitude test as they are exempt from the theoretical and practical examinations.</li>
<li>Holders of driver’s licenses from countries other than the exempt countries are required to take the aptitude test, the theoretical exam, and the practical exam.</li>
<li>Concerning the aptitude, theoretical, and practical exams.</li>
<li><ol type="i"><li>For exempt countries<br />After successful passing of the aptitude test, in accordance with the road traffic laws, there is an obligation to attend a short lecture, which must be adhered to.</li>
<li>For non-exempt countries<br />After successful passing of the aptitude test, the theoretical exam will be taken, and once this is passed, the practical examination will be taken.<br />(Aptitude test) &ndash; Involves eyesight, hearing, and physical abilities testing.<br />(Theoretical exam) &ndash; Involves 10 true/false questions<br />(Practical exam) &ndash; This exam is determined uniformly on a national level by the National Police Agency according to the ‘Driver’s License Practical Exam Implementation Criteria’, particulars of which are also specifically covered therein, and is implemented strictly in accordance to this criteria. <br />As there are different types of license administration methods for different countries, we feel this may lead to much confusion, but to acquire a Japanese driver’s license and drive within Japan, the practical exam based on the implementation criteria mentioned above must be passed.  Furthermore, in order to aim to pass the practical exam early, you can take practical lesson courses from any driving school, or borrow a practice car (charge applicable) at the Driving Centre to take an exam course held by the Road Safety Association.</li></ol></li>
<li>Concerning the short lecture.<br />Regardless of whether you fall under the exempt country category or not, there is an obligation pursuant to the Road Traffic Act to attend a short lecture before acquiring your Japanese driver’s license; it must be attended.</li></ol>
<ol start="3"><li><u>Regarding the prior screening of those applying for a Japanese driver’s license</u></li></ol>
<ol type="a"><li>In order to apply for a change of driver’s license, you will need to go through the following application process:</li>
<li><ol type="i"><li>Official confirmation of your interview date by telephone</li>
<li>Handing in of your passport, translation of your license, copies of any necessary documents, along with your filled out application form</li>
<li>Document screening (Approximately 2 weeks)</li>
<li>A decision made for the exam date after your documents have been screened</li>
<li>Take the exams</li></ol></li></ol>
<p>&ensp;Before your exam date, we will require you to come personally to the License Centre in order to make preparations for the screening of your documents (which will take from 30 minutes to an hour).  There has been mention of whether documents can be sent via fax for screening purposes.  Regarding this point, practically all country’s driver’s licenses are legitimate, but since there is a chance of a particular license being a forgery or counterfeit, it is necessary that you come and hand it to us directly for verification.  We cannot treat each country differently when it comes to document screening, so we will not screen any documents that come to us via fax.</p>
<p>&ensp;Kochi is a very long prefecture from east to west, and we want to try and reduce the burden of those who live in remote areas.  It will be necessary to inquire with the police as to whether they can accept applications, and whether a supervisor from the License Centre can proceed to the police station to collect it when one is filed and a date decided upon.</p>
<p>&ensp;There is still may be the question of whether it is really necessary to take 2 weeks to screen documents.  Regarding this, as mentioned above, there have been cases where driver’s licenses were determined to be forgeries or counterfeits, so it is necessary that the screening take this long.  However, with the exception of specific cases, we try our best to finish the document screening as soon as possible.</p>
